# Django Rest Framework Basic Token Authentication

A simple API built with Token Based Authentication. For testing the authenticate API (such as login user), i highly recommended use **Postman**.
So, there's two option to test this API. First, access the API with token that already created from superuser or access the API without token.

# How to Use?

- Clone or download this repository
- Activate virtual environment
- Create a superuser `py manage.py createsuperuser`
- Migrate them `py manage.py migrate`
- Run API using `py manage.py runserver`
- **or** run with Postman and then access with superuser
- With Postman, automatically you will receive a token. Use that to access the API
